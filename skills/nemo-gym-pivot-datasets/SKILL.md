# Nemo Gym Pivot Datasets

## Purpose

Convert agent trajectories and rollout artifacts into single-step Nemo Gym pivot
datasets for local RL or evaluation, and validate that a pivot JSONL and its Gym
config can be used together.

## Prerequisites

- Source artifacts to convert: rollout, trajectory, chat-completion, Responses API, or tool-call data.
- Python to run `scripts/validate_pivot_dataset.py` and the reference converters.
- The target Gym config (agent and resource-server names) the pivot rows must align with.
- Optionally a Gym checkout (`--gym-repo`) to validate against resource-server Pydantic models.

## Paper Reference

This skill operationalizes [PivotRL](https://arxiv.org/html/2603.21383v1): create local
single-step pivot datasets from successful trajectories, prefer informative mixed-reward states,
and train with verifier-based local rewards rather than exact trajectory imitation.

## Invocation Check

Use this skill when the task is to turn existing agent trajectories or rollout artifacts into a
Nemo Gym pivot dataset, or to validate whether a pivot JSONL/config pair can be used for
single-step local RL or evaluation.

Before writing a converter, inspect representative source rows and the target resource server.
Do not assume the source field names are the contract. Convert by reconstructing the semantic
pieces needed by Gym's Responses-style row format.

## Instructions

1. Inspect the source data shape and count the candidate assistant decision points.
2. Identify the semantic fields needed for each pivot:
  - model-call input context before the pivot action
  - available tools at that decision point
  - expected assistant action
  - reward/verifier target if it is separate from the demonstrated action
  - optional provenance such as task id, source trajectory id, rollout id, uuid, depth, and original metadata
3. Convert each accepted decision point into one pivot JSONL row.
4. Generate or update the matching Gym config so the pivot-format JSONL can be used directly.
5. Validate with the bundled validator and, when available, the target Gym resource-server models.
6. Write metrics that make skipped rows, action types, tool names, depth, and provenance coverage easy to inspect.

## Row Shape

Read [references/row-contract.md](references/row-contract.md) when implementing or reviewing a
converter. For `single_step_tool_use_with_argument_comparison`, the essential row fields are:

- `responses_create_params`: Responses API-style input and tool specs for the model call.
- `expected_action`: one `function_call` or one `message`.
- `agent_ref`: row-level agent routing that matches the generated config.

Do not copy optional null fields into `responses_create_params`; omit them unless the target
contract explicitly wants them.

`expected_action` is singular. If a source assistant turn has more than one tool call, filter that
turn out of the pivot dataset and keep it only in a skipped-row audit if it needs review.

## Conversion Patterns

Read [references/conversion-patterns.md](references/conversion-patterns.md) when the source data
is not already in pivot shape. The rule is to normalize by meaning, not by source container.

Useful reference scripts live under `scripts/reference/`. They are copied from real conversions and
may contain dataset-specific paths, assumptions, or older branch behavior, so treat them as examples
to borrow from rather than canonical commands to run unchanged:

- `generic_pivot_dataset_reference.py`: generic source rows to pivot rows.
- `chat_messages_to_pivot_dataset_reference.py`: chat-completion messages to pivot rows.
- `conversational_messages_to_pivot_dataset_reference.py`: conversational message trajectories to pivot rows with reasoning/provenance handling.
- `tool_messages_to_pivot_dataset_reference.py`: message/tool-use style rows to pivot rows.

## Pivot Selection

Use clean, positive source trajectories for the demonstrated pivots. When multiple source
trajectories exist for a task, prefer tasks whose source trajectory group has mixed rewards
instead of all success or all failure; this avoids spending data on tasks that were trivial or
impossible for the source model. Treat that source-task filter as preferred, not mandatory, because
the source model and downstream policy may have different capabilities.

When possible, profile candidate pivots with local on-policy rollouts from the downstream or
initial policy. Use at least 8 sampled local rollouts per candidate as the default. Keep candidates
with mixed local rewards, discard all-1 and all-0 reward groups, and if data is abundant, drop the
easiest/high-pass-rate pivots first so training concentrates on hard but learnable states.

## Config And Training

Read [references/config-training-and-agent-ref.md](references/config-training-and-agent-ref.md)
when creating the Gym YAML or explaining how to train/evaluate from the dataset.

Key points:

- The pivot JSONL is the training/eval dataset; point the config's train dataset entry directly at it.
- `agent_ref.name` in each row must match the agent block used by the config unless the launcher overrides routing intentionally.
- `word_count_similarity_threshold` is the main string-argument matching knob for the single-step tool-use verifier.
- Use `tool_choice: "auto"` for these rows; `tool_choice: "required"` can route some inference engines into structured decoding paths.
- Validate configs and datasets together; a valid JSONL file can still be unusable if the agent/resource-server names do not line up.

## Validation

Run the bundled validator before calling a pivot dataset done:

```bash
python scripts/validate_pivot_dataset.py --path /path/to/pivot.jsonl --agent-ref expected_agent_name
```

When the Gym repo is available, also validate against the resource-server Pydantic models:

```bash
python scripts/validate_pivot_dataset.py \
  --path /path/to/pivot.jsonl \
  --agent-ref expected_agent_name \
  --gym-repo /path/to/Gym-github
```

Use `--require-field` and `--require-any-field` only when a dataset-specific workflow needs extra
provenance checks. Provenance is useful for debugging and filtering, but it is not required by the
resource-server request model.

The validator accepts both supported expected-action types by default (`function_call` and `message`)
and prints an end summary split between tool-call and message pivots.

## Examples

Converting chat-completion logs: inspect representative rows, identify each
assistant decision point, and reconstruct `responses_create_params`,
`expected_action` (a single `function_call` or `message`), and `agent_ref` for
each accepted pivot. Route turns with more than one tool call into a skipped-row
audit. Borrow from
`scripts/reference/chat_messages_to_pivot_dataset_reference.py` rather than
running it unchanged.

Validating a finished dataset: run `scripts/validate_pivot_dataset.py` with the
expected `--agent-ref`, and add `--gym-repo` when the Gym checkout is available
to also validate against the resource-server Pydantic models.

## Limitations

- `expected_action` is singular; source turns with more than one tool call are filtered out, not split.
- Reference converters under `scripts/reference/` are dataset-specific examples, not commands to run unchanged.
- A valid JSONL file can still be unusable if the agent and resource-server names do not line up.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Resolution |
|---|---|---|
| Validator rejects rows | `agent_ref.name` does not match the config's agent block | Align `agent_ref.name` with the agent used by the generated config |
| Tool-argument matches fail | String-argument threshold too strict | Tune `word_count_similarity_threshold` for the single-step tool-use verifier |
| Structured-decoding path taken unexpectedly | `tool_choice: "required"` routes some engines there | Use `tool_choice: "auto"` for these rows |
