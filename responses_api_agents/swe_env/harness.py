"""Task model and harness contract for the SWE environment library.

The harness contract is intentionally split across a trust boundary:

* ``build_spec`` / ``supports_provider`` / ``materialize`` are **provisioning**
  methods imported and called by *agents* (and the verifier).
* ``reset_repo`` / ``run_eval`` / ``grade`` are **server-private grading**
  methods used **only** by the verifier server. A test asserts agent adapters
  never reference them.
