"""SWE dataset-family harnesses. Importing this package registers all families.

Flat host-graded families run on any exec-capable provider (including docker):
``swe-bench-ext``, ``nv-internal-1``, ``swe-rebench``. Nested-harness families
run an in-container evaluation and require an apptainer provider, failing fast on
exec-only providers: ``swe-bench``, ``swe-bench-multilingual``, ``r2e-gym``.
