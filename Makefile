# NeMo Gym — top-level convenience targets.
# Fern docs targets live at the root so contributors don't have to remember
# the exact `cd fern && npx … fern-api` invocations. CI workflows under
# `.github/workflows/fern-docs-*.yml` are the source of truth for the
# published pipeline; these targets just mirror the local-developer entry
# points.
#
# Sphinx (legacy) docs are still built via docs/Makefile; the `sphinx-*`
# targets here are thin wrappers around that.
#
# First time on this machine? Run `make docs-login` before `make docs`.
# Without dashboard provisioning, `fern docs md generate` fails with
# `HTTP 403: User does not belong to organization`.
